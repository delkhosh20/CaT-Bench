14. Grease a 23cm springform tin or a cake tin with deep sides.
15. Wrap the bottom of the tin securely with greaseproof paper or foil, so it comes up about 1 .5cm on the sides.
16. Pour the mixture into the cake tin.
17. Bake for I hour.
18. The cake is ready when a skewer inserted about 1 .5cm from the side of the tin comes out clean.
19. Note that the cake is very dense, so the top may crack when baking.

Procedure:
1. Sift the flour and cocoa powder into a bowl.
2. Make a well in the centre and whisk in the beaten eggs.
3. Gradually whisk in milk, melted butter and sugar.
4. For best results, set the pancake batter aside for 20 minutes to rest.
5. Heat a heavy-based non-stick frying pan (about 20-22cm in diameter) over moderate heat.
6. Use a piece of kitchen paper to grease the pan with a little sunflower oil.
7. Use a soup ladle to pour some batter into the middle of the pan, just enough to create a slightly thicker pancake than a crepe.
8. Cook for a minute or so until the pancake edges start to crisp up.
9. Use a palette knife to flip the pancake and cook the other side, about 1 minute.
10. Turn out of the pan and repeat with remaining batter, greasing the pan between pancakes if necessary.
11. Stack the pancakes on top of each other to keep warm.

2. Make a well in the centre and whisk in the beaten eggs.
3. Gradually whisk in milk, melted butter and sugar.
4. For best results, set the pancake batter aside for 20 minutes to rest.
5. Heat a heavy-based non-stick frying pan (about 20-22cm in diameter) over moderate heat.
6. Use a piece of kitchen paper to grease the pan with a little sunflower oil.
7. Use a soup ladle to pour some batter into the middle of the pan, just enough to create a slightly thicker pancake than a crepe.
8. Cook for a minute or so until the pancake edges start to crisp up.
9. Use a palette knife to flip the pancake and cook the other side, about 1 minute.
10. Turn out of the pan and repeat with remaining batter, greasing the pan between pancakes if necessary.
