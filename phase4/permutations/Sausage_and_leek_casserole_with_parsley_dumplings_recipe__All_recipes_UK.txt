1. Pre-heat the oven to 170 C / Gas 3.
2. It 's important to brown the sausages first in a large frying pan to get some flavour going ( use a little olive oil in the pan to get them going ).
3. Once the sausages are browned all over place in a casserole dish.
4. Now to prep the vegetables ; finely slice the onions , finely chop the garlic and cut the potatoes , carrots and leeks into roughly the same larger cuts.
5. I would cut to 1 inch in length pieces as we do n't want them to breakdown too much in the stew.
6. Add all the vegetables to the same frying pan and get a little colour on them.
7. Again , once browned add to the casserole dish - deglaze the pan with a little stock ( or white wine if you have ) and also add to the casserole dish.
8. Season the mixture well with salt and pepper and add two bay leaves - then pour over 750ml of hot chicken stock and place in the oven with a lid on for 1 hour and 15 minutes.
9. We can now make the parsley dumplings.
10. Grab a large bowl and sift in 9oz of plain flour then add 2 teaspoons of baking powder , 1 teaspoon of salt and the finely chopped parsley.
11. Make a well in the centre of the dry mix and gradually add some milk until the mixture forms into a dough consistency.
12. This mixture will make around 14 to 16 teaspoon sized dumplings - roll out the dumplings in your hands with a little flour to avoid sticking.
13. After the casserole has been in the oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes , take out and turn the oven up to 200C.
14. Add the dumplings , put back in the oven and cook for a further 30 minutes with the lid on.
15. After 30 minutes remove the lid , turn the oven up to 220C and cook for 10 to 15 minutes so you get some colour on the dumplings that have risen to the top.
