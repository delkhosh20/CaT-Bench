1. Put all the ingredients for the dough except for the semolina into a breadmaker in the order listed.
2. Add your toppings but DO N'T OVERLOAD the pizza !
3. I like to add peppers and Parma ham or smoked chorizo slices.
4. Top with a handful of grated Cheddar for that golden brown toasted cheese colour.
5. Cook in the oven until the cheese is melted and golden , 5 to 8 minutes.
6. Switch it on to the pizza setting and wait for it to finish ( about 45 minutes , depending on the model ).
7. Prepare your toppings as you wait for the dough to finish.
8. For the sauce , crush or very finely slice the garlic and add to the sieved tomatoes and oil.
9. Alternately you can blitz all the ingredients in a mini blender.
10. 10 minutes before the dough is done , turn your oven on as hot as it will go and allow it to heat up fully.
11. When the bread maker is finished , tip the dough onto a well floured surface and divide it into 3 parts for 40cm pizzas or 4 for 30cm pizzas.
12. Roll out as thinly as possible.
13. Sprinkle the base with semolina and flip onto your tray.
14. Trim off any overhangs with a sharp knife.
15. Repeat with the other dough balls.
16. At this point you can also freeze the unrolled dough balls for future use.
17. Just put some olive oil in a bag and spread it around on the inside , then store the dough ball in the sealed bag in the freezer.
18. Defrost thoroughly before using.
19. Add 2 tablespoons of the sauce to a 12 inch pizza and 3 to a 15 inch pizza.
20. Do NOT be tempted to add more or the base will go limp and soggy !
21. Next add 50 to 60g of grated mozzarella.
