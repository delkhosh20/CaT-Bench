1. Cut slits in the top of the leg of lamb every few inches , deep enough to push slices of garlic down into the meat.
2. Salt and pepper generously all over the top of lamb , place several sprigs of fresh rosemary under and on top of the lamb.
3. Roast at 180 C / Gas mark 4 , until the lamb is cooked to medium well.
4. Do not overcook ; the flavour is best if meat is still slightly pink.
must step 1 happen before step 4?
