Alternatively you can grease with unsalted butter and line with baking paper , but a liner will produce far better results.\n4. Sift the flour , baking powder , sugar and cornflour into a large mixing bowl and beat with an electric hand whisk until evenly mixed.\n5. Add the butter , eggs , lemon zest and the 3 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice.\n6. Whisk again until fully combined and smooth.\n7. Pour the mixture into the pre-lined load tin and level the top with a spatula or the back of a spoon.\n8. Make the drizzle by stirring the caster sugar and the 5 tablespoons lemon juice together in a jug.\n9. Prick the surface of the cooled loaf all over with a fork.\n10. Pour the drizzle over the loaf and allow for it to set ( once set , the drizzle will be hard ) before removing the loaf from the tin and serving.\n11. Enjoy ! : )",
    "question": "must step 2 happen before step 9?",
    "i": "2",
    "j": "9",
    "answer": "Yes, Step 2 must happen before Step 9 because Step 2 prepares the tin used to bake the loaf that is later cooled and pricked in Step 9."
