2. Add the tortellini and cook according to the instructions on the packet, however I recommend you slightly under cook it and drain.
3. In a non-stick shallow pan, heat some olive oil and gently fry the tortellini.
4. If you slightly undercooked your tortellini then it's less likely to stick to the pan.
5. Add some honey, salt to taste and around 2 tablespoons of the almond butter to the pan.
6. Continue to gently fry and stir the tortellini until golden brown.
7. Serve the tortellini with a drizzle of olive oil, freshly grated Parmesan cheese and green leaf salad of your choice.
8. Enjoy!
