Heat the stock and cook the vegetables one after the other in the stock (15 minutes for the carrots and beans, 10 minutes for courgettes and celeriac, 5 minutes for the peas).\\n3. Run the vegetables under cold water to stop them cooking.\\n4. Wash the sorrel, add the olive oil to a frying pan and cook for 3 minutes, chop then set aside.\\n5. In a saucepan, bring cream and yogurt to the boil.\\n6. Add the chopped sorrel and gelatin.\\n7. Mix well and remove from heat.\\n8. Set aside and cool for a few minutes.\\n9. Pour approximately 1cm of the cream mixture into a mould and refrigerate.\\n10. It is better to use a silicone mould, it will be easier to remove for serving.\\n11. Arrange the vegetables, alternating according to shape, starting with the matchstick vegetables on the bottom and peas in the middle.\\n12. Pour the remaining cream mixture on top.\\n13. Refrigerate the terrine for several hours until firm.\\n14. If you did'nt use a silicone mould, immerse the mould in boiling water then turn it over - it should release.\\n15.
